                <p>I got into Dan Keyes' music after going to the Dead End Kids' Club concert in 2019 - his music is exactly the type of electro-synth pop that I like. I was obsessed with "London" in November 2019 - March 2020, and "Feel It in the Water" in December 2024. I still spin these songs because they're bangers, even if they are unreleased and only available at this private link.</p></details>
