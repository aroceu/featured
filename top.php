            <p>This is an archive of the entries that have been (or could've been) spotlighted on my index page, or that I want to save here in case I want to spotlight them later. These are my internet favorites, things that I enjoy so much that I want to share them with everyone else to appreciate.</p>

            <p><strong>Note, as of 27 April 2025:</strong> As I've just launched this section, I don't <em>technically</em> have an archive of previous spotlighted posts. However, I do want to keep the actual entries to be up to date, so I've put things that I would have spotlighted if I'd made this section earlier.</p>
